## A cronic pain and recovery monitor application

This application aims to deliver a logging system for two main demographics, those 
suffering **cronic pain** and those recording their **recovery process** of various
injuries. The main way this will be achieved is by implementing several systems for
users to monitor their pain and lifestyle habits. This is not a coaching app but simply
a method for users to catalog their ailments and determine if they are improving over
a period of time. This longitudinal representation will change based off the type of data
provided by users and will allow them to more easily reccord reoccuring symptoms and behaviours  

These features are as follows:
- **Pain heat map** - record pain on an image of the human body to show the intensity, 
location, and type of pain they are currently experiencing.
- longitudinal representation of pain heat map to show progression of perceived injury
- **non localized pain log** - record of injuries or illnesses that do not conform to
localized pain, and would not be appropriate for a heat map approach
- **Exercise log** - record of type of exercise, relative intensity, and duration
- **Weight log** - record of individual weight
- **Sleep log** - record of sleep duration and perceived quality of sleep
- **Mental Health Log** - bullet journal style record of mood and relevant mental health 
factors
- **Visualization Tools** - visualizations of various statistics based on log data to help 
show progression in each of the provided metrics
- **Export Data** - potentially allowing for metrics to be exported to allow for health 
professionals to review relevant data to patient treatment
